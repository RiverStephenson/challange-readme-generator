# rivers-readme-generator

## Description

I made my project for a developer to use it so that they are prompted a list of questions about their own projects'. My generator then takes the data given and provides the user with a professional README.md file. 

## Installation

Here is the GitHub link https://github.com/RiverStephenson/rivers-readme-generator

## Usage

Once you're in the proper directory inside th terminal, type "node index.js" into the command line. You will then be prompted with a list of questions about your project and your answers will then be generated into a markdown file called "genREADME.md". That's your new README file.
